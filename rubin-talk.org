#+TITLE: A Brief Overview of the Rubin Observatory

* A Brief Overview of the Rubin Observatory

Almost everything I am going to tell you can be found in the [[https://www.lsst.org/sites/default/files/docs/sciencebook/SB_Whole.pdf][Science
Book]].  It's quite dry and a little out of date, but it is the
definitive reference for the general scientific community.

** What is the Rubin Observatory?

It is the observatory that will carry out the Legacy Survey Of Space And
Time.

It was formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
The name was changed in late 2019 to honor [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin][Vera Rubin]].

She noticed that galaxies could not behave as they did if the mass was
where the light was.  Since understanding dark matter and dark energy is
among the primary purposes of the survey, the renaming of the
observatory in her honor was particularly fitting.

*** New Nomenclature

Most of what you will find on the Web still talks about "LSST".  This
will change over time, and we have adopted a more precise set of names
for observatory components.

The Observatory as a whole is the "Vera C. Rubin Observatory"; "Rubin
Observatory" for short.

The ten-year survey is the "LSST".

The telescope is the "Simonyi Survey Telescope".

Rubin Observatory is funded by NSF, DOE, and many public and private
donors.

/Please do not call it "VRO".  Use "Rubin Observatory" instead./

** Where is it?

It's in the Andes foothills, about an hour from La Serena, Chile (57
km), on Cerro Pachón.  It is at approximately 2680m elevation.

The building has considerably more roof now.

*** Why there?

This location is excellent for optical astronomy (including infrared)
for several reasons:

*** It's in the Atacama Desert, which is extremely dry

8800 feet is much easier for humans to work at than 14,000 (Mauna Kea)
but you're still above almost all the water vapor in the air.  Expected
mean seeing is 0.67" (remember this when we talk about the camera).

*** Long partnership between United States and Chilean astronomy

First joint observatories were built in the 1960s.

(There was also a lot of Cold War politics involved.)

*** Lots of existing infrastructure

Gemini South and SOAR are also on Cerro Pachón; it's 10 km from Cerro
Tololo (CTIO).  So we had power, comms, and a road to the mountain
already.

** What is the Rubin Observatory's purpose?

The first (and currently the only) mission of the Rubin Observatory is
to execute the Legacy Survey Of Space And Time (LSST).

** Legacy Survey of Space and Time

The LSST is a ten-year survey of the southern sky.  Six bands, from
near-ultraviolet to near-infrared (320-1080nm).  We will get a complete
picture of the Southern sky (in one band or another) every three nights
(-ish, dependent on survey cadence).  This will enable detection of
faint transient phenomena with a much greater degree of completeness
than ever before.

*** How do we do that?

We will make approximately 1000 visits a night.  Each visit is either
one 30-second or two 15-second exposures.  Each picture is 3.2
gigapixels.  Then we slew the telescope and do it again, all night,
every night, for ten years, weather permitting.

*** When will we do that?

We are scheduled to begin science operations in October 2022.

However, COVID-19 has interfered (and continues to interfere) with our
schedule, so timing is uncertain.  We will be re-baselining the project
and expect a six-to-twelve-month delay.

We have successfully taken pictures of the sky with the auxiliary
telescope at the summit already.

** Data Volume

We will collect 20-ishTB of pipeline-processed data a night.  That's
equivalent to all the data collected over the Hubble Space Telescope's
30+-year lifetime /each week/.

We will take over one trillion photometric measurements of astronomical
sources.

The reduced catalogue (the primary science product) will be on the order
of 15PB: tens of billions of rows, with complex structure, in a
database.

The complete data set (with cailbrated exposures, templates, etc.) will
approach half an exabyte.

** The Symonyi Survey Telescope

The telescope is distinguished by several characteristics, imposed by
the requirements of the survey.  Chief among these are its compactness
and its rigidity, which are necessary to be able to quickly and
accurately repoint the telescope a thousand times a night and take a
picture without the telescope swaying.

*** Physical Characteristics

The telescope will make 1000 thirty-second visits a night, with five
seconds in between each visit to repoint and damp the telescope.

We have to move it from one location on the sky to another and have it
settle in 5 seconds for a change of 3.5° elevation and 7°
azimuth: 2 seconds of motion and 3 seconds to settle to 0.1".

In order to be able to move that quickly, the telescope has to be
extremely rigid.  The whole assembly weighs about 450 tons.  The azimuth
motors total 400 HP and the elevation motors 50 HP.  The rim of the
assembly is moving at about 30 mph when we are repointing.

*** Telescope optical design

This requires a very compact telescope.  It is a three-mirror design,
where M1 and M3 are part of the same piece of glass.  This is the
largest monolithic piece of glass ever constructed and seems likely to
remain so given that newer telescope designs mostly use ceramic
substrates.

*** Photon path

[[./assets/mirror.gif]]

*** What can it see?

M1M3 is 8.4m diameter.  That can collect a lot of photons.

Huge field of view: 3.5°.  (JWST is 3.2' or so.)  Seven full moons
side-by-side or a CD at arm's length.  If you calculate that out, each
pixel is about 0.6".

Single-visit depth is magnitude 24.7.  Stacked depth (to 5σ detection)
over the survey is magnitude 27.5: 30/400 million times fainter than
naked eye detection.  (The detectors saturate at magnitude 16.)

It will be the deepest ground-based survey telescope.

*** Étendue

Étendue is the product of field of view and the primary mirror area.
It's "how much light can a telescope collect in a given time?"  The
Simonyi Survey Telescope's étendue is 319 m²°², more than an order of
magnitude more than any other instrument.  Hence: wide, fast, deep.

collaboration.

(pointing at the Moon would be really dumb, but not as dumb and
dangerous as pointing at the Sun)

*** Camera design

Currently the largest (in pixel count) digital camera ever made.  Made
at SLAC.  About the physical size of a minivan.

3.2 Gpx, in 189 sensors, divided into 21 rafts (plus four wavefront
sensor rafts).  The first full-focal-plane images have just been made
(September 2020): [[https://www.space.com/vera-rubin-observatory-record-breaking-first-photos.html][space.com article]],
[[https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2020-09-08-sensors-world-largest-digital-camera-snap-first-3200-megapixel-images-slac.aspx][Stanford press release]].

374 4K HDTVs to display a complete image.  That'd tile half a
basketball court.  Remember: 1000 of those images are produced a night.

*** Camera picture

[[./assets/camera.png]]

*** Active (not adaptive) optics

We use active optics to sharpen the picture.  These are a system of
actuators to (on a timescale of about a second) compensate for mirror
deformation caused by temperature fluctuations, wind, et cetera.

We cannot use adaptive optics (much higher frequency, order of 100Hz) to
compensate for atmospheric distortion as many narrow-field telescopes
do, because our field of view is large and the air within the cone of
sight is nowhere near homogeneous.

** Observatory Cost

Total construction cost is about a half-billion (2013) dollars.

Camera: about $165 million.

M1M3: about $25 million.

Operations: about $35 million/year (or a dollar a second).  About
another half-billion over survey lifetime, factoring in commissioning
time.

Grand total, one billion dollars in round numbers.

** What science will we do with the Rubin Observatory?

There are four major pillars of the LSST research program:

+ Comprehensive solar system survey.  It's an important component of
  identifying 90% of 140m-or-bigger asteroids in earth-crossing orbits
  by 2040.  Also useful for finding Trans-Neptunian Objects.
+ Milky Way structure and stellar content.  We should observe about 10
  billion stars, mostly within the Milky Way.
+ Transient phenomena at optical wavelengths.  AGNs, SN1Ae, visual
  confirmation of LIGO detections...
+ Dark Energy and Dark Matter.  Is the Hubble Constant the same in every
  direction?  Only 4% of the mass/energy budget of the universe is
  baryonic matter and EM radiation.  What's the rest of it?

*** A few mind-blowing numbers

We should detect 10 to 40 million AGNs (quasars) over the survey
lifetime.

300,000 supernovae per year.  Current rate, across all instruments, is
7000 a year.  One supernova goes off in a Milky Way-sized galaxy every
few hundred years.  One explodes in the observable universe once every
ten seconds.

About 10 billion galaxies, and about 10 billion stars.  So everyone can
have one of each, with plenty to spare.

If I did my math right, the linear distance spanned by a pixel (0.6") at
the limit of the observable universe (46.1 billion light years distant)
is about 134,000 light years.  So a Milky Way-sized structure in the
early universe would just about span a pixel in our detector.

** Who gets to use this?

+ All astronomers affiliated with US or Chilean institutions.
+ All astronomers affiliated with institutions that have bought into the
  project either with money or with in-kind contributions (labor,
  software, et cetera).
+ Their collaborators, so pretty much all professional astronomers who
  have friends, so everyone except a few of theorists.
+ But after two years, /everyone/.  (Possibly four years after
  collection: one year for processing, so if data is collected  early 2025,
  it won't be published as part of the catalogue until the end of 2026,
  and won't be released to the public until the end of 2028.)

** Data availability

There are three levels of data products

*** Level 1

Level 1 products are alerts: something has changed significantly relative
to its historical brightness or position.  We have to issue these within
60 seconds of the shutter closing, and they can be consumed by anyone
with data rights.  We've kept this simple: anything that is present, and
wasn't before, or isn't, and was before, with a certainty of 5σ, done
with an image-subtraction algorithm.

*** Level 1 volume

It's also an enormous firehose: on the order of 10 million alerts a
night.  So there will be selective brokers (community-written, not Rubin
Observatory-supplied) that filter the Rubin-provided stream with further
processing to determine what class of event an alert is, and pass
selected alerts downstream.  Those will not have sub-minute latency.

*** Level 2

Level 2 products are our annual catalogues.  Each year, we have to
reprocess all the data collected thus far, in order to get our coadded
(stacked) data correct.  This too is immediately available upon
production to people with data rights, and two years later for the public.

Level 1 and Level 2 products are, of course, mostly automated, and the
source code for their production will be publicly available.

*** Level 3

Level 3 products are things derived from the first two categories to
support particular science goals.  This is generally "what I'm writing
the paper about" and will usually remain proprietary to the group
producing the research.

** EPO

Education and Public Outreach will be coordinating curricula (from
middle school to college astronomy courses) and organizing citizen
science projects (think Zooniverse).  As someone interested in the
project who is not a professional astronomer, I sympathize with their
aims.

** What's my role in all this?

I work in the Science Quality and Reliability Engineering (SQuaRE) team,
within the Data Management organization of the Rubin Observatory.  My
particular focus is the interactive notebook aspect of the Science
Platform.

I have worked in IT as a system administrator, software developer,
consultant, engineer, and plenty of other roles, for more than 30
years.

I have never taken an astronomy course.
